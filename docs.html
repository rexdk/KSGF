<h1>KSGF</h1>
<div><b>KSGF</b> is a javascript library to represent a Hex game, and to read and write the game in SGF format.
</div>
<div>SGF is <a href="https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/">"Smart Game Format"</a>, which is a plain text format. SGF is easily portable, and can be read by humans.
</div>
<div>All SGF properties will be read; the following properties are understood:<br />
&nbsp Root node: FF ( must be FF[4] ), GM ( must be GM[11] ), SZ, PL, AB, AW, C, IP<br />
&nbsp Other nodes: B, W, IP, C.<br />
&nbsp B[swap-pieces] and W[swap-pieces] set the .swap property of the move to true. <br />
&nbsp All these properties, and aditionally the AP property,  will by written where appropriate in the SGF output
</div>
<div> Usage: Place the library in the &lthead> section of your web page. There are 3 'classes' and some utilities.<br />
&nbsp See the files test1.html, test2.html etc for examples.
</div>

<h2>Game</h2>
<div>
The Game class represents a Hex Game.
</div>
<h3>Constructor</h3>
<h4>Game()</h4>
<div>The game has these initial values: rows = cols = 11; first player = KSGF.BLACK;
</div>

<h3>Properties</h3>
<h4>.addedBlackStones</h4>
<div>This is an array of Cells (see the Cell class below) occupied by black stones which have been added to the board before play begins.
This will not happen in a real game, but may be helpful eg when exploring a template.
</div>
<h4>.addedWhiteStones</h4>
<div>See .addedBlackStones.
This is an array of Cells (see the Cell class below) occupied by added white stones.
</div>
<h4>.cols</h4>
<div>The number of columns for this game's board.
</div>
<h4>.currentMove</h4>
<div>The last move that was made in the actual game. Other moves may have been explored.
</div>
<h4>.currentTurn</h4>
<div>Whose turn it is to play next in the actual game (KSGF.BLACK or KSGF.WHITE)
</div>
<h4>.errorCode</h4>
<div>Identifier for the last error encountered when reading a game; see .getErrorMessage() too.
</div>
<h4>.firstPlayer</h4>
<div>KSGF.BLACK (the default) or KSGF.WHITE, to indicate which player plays first.
</div>
<h4>.rootMove</h4>
<div>The root of the game tree. rootMove is a Move (see the Move class below), which has a list of first moves, played or explored (.nextMoves[]).
Those next Moves also have possible nextMoves[] and so on, so the moves in the game are represented by a game tree.
</div>
<h4>.rows</h4>
<div>The number of rows for this game's board.
</div>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<h4>.addBlackStone(cell)</h4>
<h4>.addBlackStone(row, col)</h4>
<h4>.addBlackStone(cellIDText)</h4>
<div>Checks the proposed cell is available, then adds a black stone there in the set-up position.
Returns <b>true</b> for success and <b>false</b> otherwise.<br />
cell is an instance of the Cell or Move class, see below, or eg {row: 4, col: 5}.<br />
row, col are integer values for the row and column of the move<br />
cellIDText is a text representation of the cell, eg "a5", "g11" etc. where columns are given a single letter  a,b,c...
</div>
<h4>.addWhiteStone(cell)</h4>
<h4>.addWhiteStone(row, col)</h4>
<h4>.addWhiteStone(cellIDText)</h4>
<div>Checks the proposed cell is available, then adds a white stone there in the set-up position.
Returns <b>true</b> for success and <b>false</b> otherwise.<br />
cell is an instance of the Cell or Move class, see below, or eg {row: 4, col: 5}.<br />
row, col are integer values for the row and column of the move<br />
cellIDText is a text representation of the cell, eg "a5", "g11" etc. where columns are given a single letter  a,b,c...
</div>
<h4>.changeTurn()</h4>
<div>Changes .currentTurn from KSGF.BLACK to KSGF.WHITE or vice versa.
</div>
<h4>.decode(text)</h4>
<div>Decodes the text, given in Smart Game Format (SGF). If successful, sets the game from the data and returns <b>true</b>. If unsuccessful, leaves the existing game untouched and returns <b>false</b>; .getErrorMessage() and .errorCode will indicate the problem. If multiple games are given by the text, only the first is decoded.
</div>
<h4>.encode()</h4>
<div>Returns a formatted SGF representation of this game.
The resulting text is indented so that it is easier for a human to read.
</div>
<h4>.erase()</h4>
<div>Sets the current move to the previous move, if there is one, and erases the old current move and any following branches. (See also .goBack)
</div>
<h4>.getErrorMessage()</h4>
<div>Returns text describing the last error encountered when reading a game; see .errorCode too.
</div>
<h4>.goBack()</h4>
<div>Sets the current move to the previous move, if there is one. The game tree is otherwise unaffected. (See also .erase)
</div>
<h4>.isCellEmpty(cell)</h4>
<h4>.isCellEmpty(row, col)</h4>
<h4>.isCellEmpty(cellIDText)</h4>
<div>Returns <b>true</b> if the given cell is empty (and on the board), or otherwise <b>false</b>.<br />

row, col are integer values for the row and column of the move<br />
cellIDText is a text representation of the cell, eg "a5", "g11" etc. where columns are given a single letter  a,b,c...
</div>
<h4>.isCellOnBoard(cell)</h4>
<h4>.isCellOnBoard(row, col)</h4>
<h4>.isCellOnBoard(cellIDText)</h4>
<div>Returns <b>true</b> if the given cell is on the board, or otherwise <b>false</b>.<br />
cell is an instance of the Cell or Move class, see below, or eg {row: 4, col: 5}.<br />
row, col are integer values for the row and column of the move<br />
cellIDText is a text representation of the cell, eg "a5", "g11" etc. where columns are given a single letter  a,b,c...
</div>
<h4>.makeMove(cell)</h4>
<h4>.makeMove(row, col)</h4>

row, col are integer values for the row and column of the move<br />
cellIDText is a text representation of the cell, eg "a5", "g11" etc. where columns are given a single letter  a,b,c...
</div>
<h4>.stripComments(move)</h4>
<div>Removes any comments from the given Move and any branches above it.
When move is the rootMove, this therefore strips all comments from the game tree.
SGF text without comments is more readable.
</div>
<br />

<h2>Move</h2>
<div>The Move class represents a Move on the board, that is the placing of a BLACK or WHITE stone.
The game is represented as a tree of Moves, starting from a root move with branches for moves that have been played or explored.
The root move (or root node) contains a list of possible first moves.
</div>
<h3>Constructor</h3>
<h4>Move(cell)</h4>
<h4>Move(row, col)</h4>
<h4>Move(cellIDText)</h4>
<div>
cell - an instance of the Cell or Move class, or eg {row: 4, col: 5}.<br />
row - the (integer) row number of the Move's cell, starting at 1.<br />
col - the (integer) column number of the Move's cell, starting at 1.<br />
cellIDText - a text representation of the Move's cell, eg "a5", "g11" etc. where columns are given a single letter  a,b,c...
</div>

<h3>Properties</h3>
<h4>.comment</h4>
<div>A comment about this move in plain text format
</div>
<h4>.col</h4>
<div>The (integer) col number of the cell, starting at 1.
</div>
<h4>.nextMoves</h4>
<div>An array of moves that have been played or explored from this position.
Game.currentMove should have been set to the last move actually played, which determines whether a move has been played and merely explored.
</div>
<h4>.previousMove</h4>
<div>The move that was made before this one. Note that the root Move does not have a previous move, so .previousMove is set to null.
</div>
<h4>.row</h4>
<div>The (integer) row number of the cell, starting at 1.
</div>
<h4>.swap</h4>
<div>This is set to true</b> if the move represents a swap of the pieces ([swap-pieces] in SGF). Otherwise this property is absent.
Code: <i>if (move.swap) {...}</i> can be used to determine if the move is a swap.
</div>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<h4>.getNextMove()</h4>
<div>Returns the first given next move, or <b>null</b> if none.
Might be useful if there are no branches of explored moves, just played moves.
</div>
<h4>.getnextMoveOnPath(targetMove)</h4>
<div>Returns the next move on the path to targetMove, or <b>null</b> if unsuccessful.
Useful if proceeding towards the current move (ie Game.currentMove).
</div>
<h4>.isOnPathTo(targetMove)</h4>
<div>Returns <b>true</b> if this move is is on the path to targetMove, or <b>false</b> otherwise.
When targetMove is the current move (ie Game.currentMove), this indicates whether this move has been played (or merely explored)
</div>
<h4>.isRoot()</h4>
<div>Returns <b>true</b> if this is the root move, or <b>false</b> otherwise.
</div>
<h4>.nextMovesCount()</h4>
<div>Returns the number of next moves played or explored
